        JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
        JSON is a text format for storing and transporting data
        JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand
        
        ->JSON Example
          This example is a JSON string: '{"name":"John", "age":30, "car":null}'

        It defines an object with 3 properties:
            name
            age
            car
        Each property has a value.
        If you parse the JSON string with a JavaScript program, you can access the data as an object:
        let personName = obj.name;
        let personAge = obj.age;

        What is JSON?
            JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
            JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format
            JSON is plain text written in JavaScript object notation
            JSON is used to send data between computers
            JSON is language independent *

        What is JavaScript object notation used for?
            JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured
            data based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in 
            web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, 
            so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa)

        Why Use JSON?
            The JSON format is syntactically similar to the code for creating JavaScript objects. 
            Because of this, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into JavaScript objects.

            Since the format is text only, JSON data can easily be sent between computers, 
            and used by any programming language.

            JavaScript has a built in function for converting JSON strings into JavaScript objects:
            JSON.parse()

            JavaScript also has a built in function for converting an object into a JSON string:
            JSON.stringify()

        Storing Data
            When storing data, the data has to be a certain format, and regardless of where you 
            choose to store it, text is always one of the legal formats.

            JSON makes it possible to store JavaScript objects as text.

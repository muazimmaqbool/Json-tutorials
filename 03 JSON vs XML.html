    <title>JSON vs XML</title>

    <pre><h3>
    Both JSON and XML can be used to receive data from a web server.

    The following JSON and XML examples both define an employees object, with an array of 3 employees:
        JSON:
            {"employees":[
                { "firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe" },
                { "firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith" },
                { "firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones" }
            ]}
        
        XML:
         can only be seen inside code please check in code editor
        
        <employees>
            <employee>
              <firstName>John</firstName> <lastName>Doe</lastName>
            </employee>
            <employee>
              <firstName>Anna</firstName> <lastName>Smith</lastName>
            </employee>
            <employee>
              <firstName>Peter</firstName> <lastName>Jones</lastName>
            </employee>
          </employees> 

    JSON is Like XML Because
        Both JSON and XML are "self describing" (human readable)
        Both JSON and XML are hierarchical (values within values)
        Both JSON and XML can be parsed and used by lots of programming languages
        Both JSON and XML can be fetched with an XMLHttpRequest
    
    JSON is Unlike XML Because
        JSON doesn't use end tag
        JSON is shorter
        JSON is quicker to read and write
        JSON can use arrays
    
    The biggest difference is:
        XML has to be parsed with an XML parser. JSON can be parsed by a standard JavaScript function.
    
    Why JSON is Better Than XML?
        XML is much more difficult to parse than JSON.
        JSON is parsed into a ready-to-use JavaScript object.
